    "text": "Once two people had come to see Bhagwan. Bhagwan let them in and even made them sit. He then cast a penetrating look at them and asked what they were doing. One said he was selling handicrafts and the other said he was selling chappals. Then after a minute he asked again ‘what are you doing’. Again one answered that he was selling handicrafts and the other said he was selling chappels. This went on eight times. People began to think Bhagwan had become senile. Then Bhagwan called all those people inside and made them put the same question to those two people. Now this also went on some eight times. By this time the two people realised that Swamy is not going to leave them unless they told the truth. They confessed that they were smugglers and weresmuggling sandalwood. They asked for forgiveness. Bhagwan said to them that it was not about being forgiven, they should not be doing such a bad thing, a papa. They said they would stop it and began to leave. But Swamy called them back and asked ‘where are you going’. They said they were going to their village. Bhagwan repeated ‘where are you going’. Now they knew that nothong can escape Bhagwan and told him that they were going to Salem to meeta certain person in this connection. Then Bhagwan sternly warned them that they would definitely be caught by the police if they went to Salem. The anger and the forceful words did something to them and this time they said that would really change their ways and take care of their families with hard earned money.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

Then Bhagavan started talking about Ma’s family and he enquired how many brothers/ sisters does Ma have.Ma told the number of brothers and sisters she had in the family.

    "text": "It is said in the upanishad, when u know THAT - the ultimate truth, you know about everything else also. This incident shows how yogiji knew about so manythings even though He calls himself a dirty beggar. Rajmanika Nadar &Rajdurai Nadar were a great devotee of Bhagwan insisted on purchasing a house at Sannathi street for Bhagwan ..Yogiji had suffered a lot at the hands of hooligans …to which he agreed.\nIn course of time, Rajdurai Nadar passed away. Rajamanickam Nadar wanted to a memorial for him and insisted that his son Chandraprakash to take permission from Bhagwan to have his memorial which was permitted by bhagwan. They visited Gandhigram and saw a gandhi stupi which was 32 feet. They reported this to Bhagwan and He okayed for 32 feet memorial. He visited place near Kanyakumari, Mailadi, bought a sample of polished granite and showed it to Bhagwan. Bhagwan had one look at it and said “NO”. THen he went to Mahabalipuram and showed the stone to Bhagwan but every time he said no. Bhagavan said near sivakasi, there is a place called “Kaiyanallur” . There is a mahatma called Ponaiyya swamigal. They had built a memorial . HE asked them to go and ask where they got the stone. They found it was from Kodangipatti. They saw 5 hills and there was a village with stone cutters doing their job for generations. Then Bhagwan aksed him to go to mahabalipuram and meet Ganapathi stapathi to get the drawing ready. Ganapathi stapathi was an expert in temple architecture. He happily agreed to do the job after he heard the name of Bhagwan and insisted to meet Bhagwan. Then Bhagwan approved the drawing. He wanted 16ftx16ft stones. The people in Kodangipatti said, out of the 5 hills, they use only 2. One had a murugan temple and the other two the stones were brittle. So they said 16x16ft stone is not possible . Bhagwan asked Chandraprakash to describe what he saw there in Kodangipatti. Swami said go ask the stone cutters to cut stone from the mountain that is facing the Murugan temple. The stone cutters said that the hill that swami had mentioned is very brittle. But Swami insisted.. only that mountain should be cut. So he approached the people again and insisted to cut that hill. Then they agreed but wanted daily wages. They used an explosive and to their surprise, they found out that it was not brittle. They could find huge stones as requested by Ganapathi sthapathi. Swami also asked Ganapathi stapathi to go see Gyananandha memorial..It was hexogonal and Swami said he wanted the same kind of structure. When it was completed, Bhagwan said it will be a holy place and it will be this Beggar’s statue there. And who ever came and prayed there after lighting agarbathi, their prayers will be answered.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

    "text": "Two brothers had bought a bail petition to Bhagwan for his blessings. After they leave Bhagwan tells the story of Mr A gave a loan of 15 rupees to his brother Mr B. they were both pious but somehow Mr B did not return the money even after long time. Furthermore Mr A asks for money to be returned from Mr B infront of friends,which resulted in open fight with assaults. Mr B dies that night, at which point Mr A came to Bhagwan smugly saying that his brother had been punished by God. Bhagwan however retorts that despite your pious nature you asked for a sum of mere 15 rupees from your brother, fought with him openly and now that he has died you will be put in jail. The police will connect the two events you too will suffer. True to that MR A was put behind bars. Bail was also denied as murder was suspected. Bhagwan says” Where there is Faith there is No Fate. But you have to remember Bhagwan constantly. Be ever vigilant and alert, even a minutes lapse in remembering Bhagwan’s name will result in Fate breaking havoc. In moments of weakness the mind will go after wordly things and along with that Fate will also enter, negative forces are kept away as long as you are chanting the name. Bhagwan qoutes ” In Ramayan Kaikeyi loves Rama was remembering Sri Rama all the time. But the lamenting by Manthra leads to a moment of lapse and we all know what happened after that”\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

Bhagwan got really angry that his calculations had gone wrong now and asked it to be returned with a word that His account with the hotel had now closed.

They tried home remedies for three months but the pain did not go away. At the end of December, they took an xray, they were surprised. She had cancerous growth in her bone marrow and it had spread as well. He called his mother Thilagavathy Rajasekar and informed her. Isswaryaa’s mother took her to a specialist in Chennai and he advised knee replacement surgery. He advised to abort the child to prevent complications arising out of surgery to the child. Isswarya was stubborn to carry the child. Uma , Thilagavathy Rajasekar asked them to inform Swami and they informed Bhagavan through Mani. Bhagavan was rubbing his right knee for sometime and while he got up after darshan, he fell down. Dr. Rajasekar came for the darshan of Bhagavan and Rajeswari Amma told him that there might be no darshan for three more days as he got hurt. However Karunaamoorthy Bhagavan came to the breakfast hut the following day. They had darshan of Bhagavan and He said, Thilagavathy is a friend of Lord Sundareshwara. Lord Sundareshwara will definitely help her. Definitely there is no need of operation for Isswarya.’ This was informed to Isswarya and the doctor put plaster cast and sent her to Sivakasi. One day Isswarya fell down and hurt herself. Whatever we say will start becoming true. If you do japa for 8 hours, you will know that you are no different from the mantra and you will become the mantra. After that everything will be bliss. There will be no hunger, no sleep, no identification of others. You will be beyodn the mind and you will go closer to God. As you do japa intnesely, it will start pulling you towards God and take you to God. You will be beyond your control and you will surrender to God. You will get whatever you ask for. You knwo what is bigger happiness - God will start giving you everything that you need. Your word will become God’s word.Your action will become God’s action. The person asked what would happen after 8 hours of japa bravely. You will want to do japa all the time, all the 24 hours. You should do japa like your breath. it should be natural like your breath."

Now like from an Akshaya Pathram, just as Krishna in Mahabharata took a grain of food and satisfied the hunger of Rishi Durvasa and all his ten thousand disciples, under Bhagwan’s grace physical quantity of Upma grew and all of them were satisfied. Bhagwan too had upma in his coconut shell. Another time one other devotee brought food and when Bhagwan asked her to serve, the sambar had been spoilt and was emanating a bad smell. Still Bhagwan ate and asked her what else she had brought. She had brought payasam and served that too in the same coconut shell. Now there were about a dozen cashews floating in it. Sri Vidya was happy that Bhagwan would have this. But then Bhagwan gave Srividhya, not even the other devotee who had brought them, all the cashews one by one. Then Bhagwan asked the other devotee to serve sambar again. Now there were about a dozen chillies floating in it. Sri Vidya was afraid Bhagwan would make her eat them. She was asked not to take chillies and had avoided it in her diet. But to her horror Bhagwan took the chillies and ate all of them himself. He then smiled at her as if all her troubles had been taken by him and only good things given to her. Once Bhagwan had a string of flowers some 7 or eight flowers in it. There were about 20 or so devotees and Bhagwan gave them flower prasad and as he kept giving somehow the quantity of flowers kept increasing and all of them received it. Still Bhagwan had a flower or two in his hands. He was Akshaya pathram himself.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

She had an eight month baby was travelling from Chennai as she was in great difficulty. Ma Devaki sought Bhagwans permission to bring her friend from temple. It was fast approaching 12 pm at which point Bhagwan would go inside the house. Ma Devaki suddenly said “Bhagwan Should I go I will be back in 7 min”. Bhagwan suddenly says “Jai Rama if Devaki doesn’t return in 7 min we will put her bag outside.” This meant Bhagwan would not give Darshan. Ma Devaki runs to temple much to surprise of everyone on street only to find her friend is not there , She runs back mindful of 7mins and reaches house at exactly 7th minute. Bhagwan doesn’t say anything but after sometime Bhagwan drops a Modak in Ma Devaki hand. Ma Devaki had wished for this earlier. Another half an hour later he asks her to go to temple as he said her friend is there now. She comes and cries infront of Bhagwan, laments that her husband was being tortured in Gulf country by making him work relentlessly. The eight month old baby was at his feet, this child catches hold of Bhagwan’s Thumb which was always constantly moving taking Rama name. The other hand was stroking the baby with utmost tenderness and Love.At the end of 30 mins Bhagwan says” Now you can take your child. My Father’s work is done”. He blessed her saying, “My Father will help you,you need not worry”. The lady’s husband comes back from.Gulf gets job elsewhere. They were happy. Ma Devaki says that child for 3 years of age would say ” Anusha wants this, the Body wants this, it wants something ” always in third person. It was after 3rd year that parents got angry with her on that and changed this habit. Ma Devaki says 30min with Bhagwan and for 3 years the child was unable to say “I” and “Mine”.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

The first day he came to Thiruvannamalai, he went to Arunachaleswara temple and he ran into our Bhagavan. He started visit Bhagavan regularly. He has written many articles in the ashram magazine on his experiences. He casually asked Bhagavan if he could bring food for him and Bhagavan agreed with a condition that only the family members should cook the food. Also he said that a family member should bring the food. He happily agreed and he brought chapathi and sabji in the morning and rice gruel in the evening. He had gone through many miracles in the one year. He was transferred again. He visited Bhagavan and sought his blessings for his second daughter’s marriage. Bhagavan blessed him and also quoted an incident from Ramayana. Bharathwaja maharishi was staying in the outskirts of Ayodhya. When Bharatha was on his way to the forest to get back Rama, he visited the ashram and Bharathwaja Maharishi asked them to stay in the ashram. The ashram was a simple kutir and Bharatha wondered how his army , queens and minister would be taken care of. By the strength of his penance, Bharathwaja maharishi provided accomodation to the ministers according to their ranks and peovided all the food for Bharatha’s royal ministry. Bhagavan mentioned that his daughter’s marriage would be taken care of like that. He also asked his friedn who had come along with K. V. Vishwanathan to come and report after the marriage. The marriage took place in a hostel with three floors. Vishwanathan was there on the first floor doing the vedic rituals, while the guests were invited in the ground floor. His friend saw Vishwanathan in the ground floor attending to the guests in the ground floor. He was wondering how he could be present in the gorund floor while he was attending to the vedic rituals. However when he went up to the first floor, Vishwanathan told his friend how he regretted not being in the ground floor inviting guests. The friend was shocked and he told Vishwanathan that he was very much present in the ground floor receiving the guests. Now Vishwanathan knew it was Bhagavan who had come and performed this leela as he had promised. His friend went and reported the whole incident to Bhagavan and Bhagavan attributed to his Father. Bhagavan also blessed one scheme of Vishanathan and assured that his district would be number one and Vishwanathan’s scheme was a grand success and true to Bhagavan’s words, it ranked number one.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

He ran to Bhagwan to lament about it, but Bhagwan even before he could say anything Bhagwan asks him if he knew about Theory of Evolution. Sri Rajan goes on to explain the same and in course is asked by Bhagwan to specifically ask what Theory of Mutation is. Sri Rajan elaborates by giving example of how butterflies in an industrial town became easy prey to enemies as they were colourful against soot that was being produced by heavy industrial work in the town. Over time their numbers declined and in defence their colour also changed to dark to escape being preyed upon. Sri Rajan says this is mutation fundamental change at gene level to protect oneself. Bhagwan then says This Beggar would like some mutation in you, And straight away asks him how much money had he put in the business. Sri Rajan was stunned as he had not even touched upon this story and Bhagwan already knew what was happening. Bhagwan guides him to leave the matter, go above his sister actions and rise above the selfishness. Sri Rajan slowly understands that Bhagwan was asking a fundamental change in him to go above the petty quarrels, be less selfish and maybe that would bring a change in his sister also.

One day wallowing in self pity and agony as he was going, he met a Hindu friend of his who asked him why he was so miserable. On hearing his situation the Hindu friend asked him to go and see one Swamiji, our Bhagwan. The muslim, his name is Abdul said that he had heard about him but was apprehensive because VIPs came to see that Swamiji and he was muslim and very poor also. He had doubts if the Swamiji would see him. His Hindu friend said that he cannot have such thoughts even without making an attempt to see Bhagwan. So the next day Abdul went to see Bhagwan. The queue was very long, the sun was scorching and as time passed Abdul thought that he could never make it. He then even decided to leave. At that moment Bhagwan’s assistant came running and shouting that there was a muslim in the queue whom Bhagwan wanted to see immediately. Abdul was surprised how Bhagwan knew he was a muslim. When he saw Bhagwan he prostrated but Bhagwan stopped him saying his religion did not permit that. Bhagwan then asked him what he wanted, blessed him and said “Sowkhiyama iruppe” meaning you will live well. Before leaving Abdul requested a photo of Bhagwan. To this Bhagwan said that in his religion they dont pray this way. Bhagwan blessed him saying “Pray to Allah. Allah blesses you”. Thereafter in a few days he got a good job with a decent salary in the PWD department. He was posted elsewhere and he moved on. He was so happy and grateful to Bhagwan, he came to see bhagwan once or twice. After Bhagwan’s samadhi he had come now and by this time it was 5’O Clock which was his Namaz time. He then sought permission to do Namaz in front of the samadhi siva linga of Bhagwan who was God himself.
