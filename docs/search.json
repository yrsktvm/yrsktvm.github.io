    "text": "Once two people had come to see Bhagwan. Bhagwan let them in and even made them sit. He then cast a penetrating look at them and asked what they were doing. One said he was selling handicrafts and the other said he was selling chappals. Then after a minute he asked again ‘what are you doing’. Again one answered that he was selling handicrafts and the other said he was selling chappels. This went on eight times. People began to think Bhagwan had become senile. Then Bhagwan called all those people inside and made them put the same question to those two people. Now this also went on some eight times. By this time the two people realised that Swamy is not going to leave them unless they told the truth. They confessed that they were smugglers and weresmuggling sandalwood. They asked for forgiveness. Bhagwan said to them that it was not about being forgiven, they should not be doing such a bad thing, a papa. They said they would stop it and began to leave. But Swamy called them back and asked ‘where are you going’. They said they were going to their village. Bhagwan repeated ‘where are you going’. Now they knew that nothong can escape Bhagwan and told him that they were going to Salem to meeta certain person in this connection. Then Bhagwan sternly warned them that they would definitely be caught by the police if they went to Salem. The anger and the forceful words did something to them and this time they said that would really change their ways and take care of their families with hard earned money.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

    "text": "Sri Kanagavelrajan was a zoology professor, who entered into baking business with his sister. Somehow they fall out and have a misunderstanding, the sister declares that brother had never invested in the business despite him having put 10,000 rupees in the business. He ran to Bhagwan to lament about it, but Bhagwan even before he could say anything Bhagwan asks him if he knew about Theory of Evolution. Sri Rajan goes on to explain the same and in course is asked by Bhagwan to specifically ask what Theory of Mutation is. Sri Rajan elaborates by giving example of how butterflies in an industrial town became easy prey to enemies as they were colourful against soot that was being produced by heavy industrial work in the town. Over time their numbers declined and in defence their colour also changed to dark to escape being preyed upon. Sri Rajan says this is mutation fundamental change at gene level to protect oneself. Bhagwan then says This Beggar would like some mutation in you, And straight away asks him how much money had he put in the business. Sri Rajan was stunned as he had not even touched upon this story and Bhagwan already knew what was happening. Bhagwan guides him to leave the matter, go above his sister actions and rise above the selfishness. Sri Rajan slowly understands that Bhagwan was asking a fundamental change in him to go above the petty quarrels, be less selfish and maybe that would bring a change in his sister also. Bhagwan taught him to see through eyes of Love.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

    "text": "One Pandian from Madurai used to come on Pournami days to Thiruvannamalai for girivalam. He would then come promptly at the Ashram Gate where Bhagwan after giving darshan outside Pradhan Mandir would go to the car at exactly 7 O’clock. Here all people would stand by the road side and Bhagwan would give Car Darshan. Bhagwan would see everybody there, raise his hands and bless them. This Pandian also used to stand there in the line and get darshan. This happened many times and one day seeing that people were asking Bhagwan for a personal darshan, he too wanted to see Bhagwan. They would write their names and Bhagwan would call them. So he too wrote his name and waited. Two pournamis went by and it was only the third time he was called by Bhagwan. Bhagwan asked his name, enquired about his business and then just asked if he had seen Bhagwan before now. Pandian was taken aback. He replied that he had been coming for over 4 or 5 years and had been having Car Darshan of Bhagwan. At this point Bhagwan strongly refuted him saying Pandian had been coming for Car Darshan exactly 37 times. Pandian felt it must have been many more times than that. He had been marking the days he had been to Thiruvannamalai and going home when he counted, it was exactly 37 times. In fact Pandian would humorously say that the moment anyone goes to see Bhagwan, Bhagwan would open an account for them.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

There is one other similar incident when Bhagwan, Ma Devaki and others were seated in a garden. Sri Ilayaraja had come to see Bhagwan. Bhagwan then asked him to sing. He sang so beautifully and after it was over all fell into a silence, a deep silence with Bhagwan’s divine presence accentuating the pleasant evening making the atmosphere perfect. At that moment a crow began to cry and all were shaken out of the mood. But Bhagwan was enjoying this also saying it was his Father’s sweet music and started laughing and laughing.

Manorama Devi went around telling everybody with pride that Swamy had sent all these for her and it would last her for a year. Keeping this in mind when Mataji Ram Ranjani Devi came, she was also hoping to get lots of packets of incense sticks. But since nothing was coming, she sent her daughter, Bina to ask her father. Bhagwan flared but then started a leela of searching the whole place for incense sticks. They found just two sticks not even two packets which Bhagwan gave to Bina to be given to her mother. Naturally both were upset. But then being Mataji Ram Ranjani Devi realised that she should not have imitated the other woman. Had she asked for something which she needed, Bhagwan would have given and given with blessings too. This incident is a lesson for us too that we should not and need not ape anyone. Bhagwan is like a doctor who gives us what we need, not what we want. Our requirements are unique and Bhagwan is taking care of this. This assurance is there and we need to have no complaints.

    "text": "Srividhya, a devotee took Upma food for Bhagwan. Bhagwan used to accept food from her. This time when she went there were about 12 to 13 people in all. So she waited for them to leave to serve upma later. But Bhagwan asked her to serve to all. She had taken upma just enough for two people, but then she began to serve. Now like from an Akshaya Pathram, just as Krishna in Mahabharata took a grain of food and satisfied the hunger of Rishi Durvasa and all his ten thousand disciples, under Bhagwan’s grace physical quantity of Upma grew and all of them were satisfied. Bhagwan too had upma in his coconut shell. Another time one other devotee brought food and when Bhagwan asked her to serve, the sambar had been spoilt and was emanating a bad smell. Still Bhagwan ate and asked her what else she had brought. She had brought payasam and served that too in the same coconut shell. Now there were about a dozen cashews floating in it. Sri Vidya was happy that Bhagwan would have this. But then Bhagwan gave Srividhya, not even the other devotee who had brought them, all the cashews one by one. Then Bhagwan asked the other devotee to serve sambar again. Now there were about a dozen chillies floating in it. Sri Vidya was afraid Bhagwan would make her eat them. She was asked not to take chillies and had avoided it in her diet. But to her horror Bhagwan took the chillies and ate all of them himself. He then smiled at her as if all her troubles had been taken by him and only good things given to her. Once Bhagwan had a string of flowers some 7 or eight flowers in it. There were about 20 or so devotees and Bhagwan gave them flower prasad and as he kept giving somehow the quantity of flowers kept increasing and all of them received it. Still Bhagwan had a flower or two in his hands. He was Akshaya pathram himself.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

Bhagwan said this was Father’s wish that Gangappa had to come from Tumkur and work for the Kumbabhishekam, which was therefore a very divine incident. Bhagwan said it was Father who carried out all actions through all people and that we are all mere puppets in His Hands. In fact, He said we did not do anything and we did not exist. In this great world stage, it is Father who is playing all these different roles through all of us.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

He waited and waited and Bhagwan came at 10.30 at night. Alwar rushed to him but Bhagwan sternly refused to see him and simply bolted the door. This was not expected and so Alwar was so heart broken. He wept himself out for an hour there itself booked a room, wept the whole night and next day at 4 in the morning went to see Bhagwan. He was afraid Bhagwan might not see him at all. He was absolutely humbled. But then at about 5’O Clock he suddenly heard the heavy beats of Siva Thandavam. He looked up and was dumbstruck to see Bhagwan performing an Ananda Shiva Thandavam. The Cosmic dance was so divine Alwar would not even blink his eye. This blessing continued for 45 minutes. Alwar was simply flabbergasted. Bhagwan then signals him to come and immediately takes him in and offers to spend the a whole day with him.

They tried home remedies for three months but the pain did not go away. At the end of December, they took an xray, they were surprised. She had cancerous growth in her bone marrow and it had spread as well. He called his mother Thilagavathy Rajasekar and informed her. Isswaryaa’s mother took her to a specialist in Chennai and he advised knee replacement surgery. He advised to abort the child to prevent complications arising out of surgery to the child. Isswarya was stubborn to carry the child. Uma , Thilagavathy Rajasekar asked them to inform Swami and they informed Bhagavan through Mani. Bhagavan was rubbing his right knee for sometime and while he got up after darshan, he fell down. Dr. Rajasekar came for the darshan of Bhagavan and Rajeswari Amma told him that there might be no darshan for three more days as he got hurt. However Karunaamoorthy Bhagavan came to the breakfast hut the following day. They had darshan of Bhagavan and He said, Thilagavathy is a friend of Lord Sundareshwara. Lord Sundareshwara will definitely help her. Definitely there is no need of operation for Isswarya.’ This was informed to Isswarya and the doctor put plaster cast and sent her to Sivakasi. One day Isswarya fell down and hurt herself. Whatever we say will start becoming true. If you do japa for 8 hours, you will know that you are no different from the mantra and you will become the mantra. After that everything will be bliss. There will be no hunger, no sleep, no identification of others. You will be beyodn the mind and you will go closer to God. As you do japa intnesely, it will start pulling you towards God and take you to God. You will be beyond your control and you will surrender to God. You will get whatever you ask for. You knwo what is bigger happiness - God will start giving you everything that you need. Your word will become God’s word.Your action will become God’s action. The person asked what would happen after 8 hours of japa bravely. You will want to do japa all the time, all the 24 hours. You should do japa like your breath. it should be natural like your breath."

He had gone through many miracles in the one year. He was transferred again. He visited Bhagavan and sought his blessings for his second daughter’s marriage. Bhagavan blessed him and also quoted an incident from Ramayana. Bharathwaja maharishi was staying in the outskirts of Ayodhya. When Bharatha was on his way to the forest to get back Rama, he visited the ashram and Bharathwaja Maharishi asked them to stay in the ashram. The ashram was a simple kutir and Bharatha wondered how his army , queens and minister would be taken care of. By the strength of his penance, Bharathwaja maharishi provided accomodation to the ministers according to their ranks and peovided all the food for Bharatha’s royal ministry. Bhagavan mentioned that his daughter’s marriage would be taken care of like that. He also asked his friedn who had come along with K. V. Vishwanathan to come and report after the marriage. The marriage took place in a hostel with three floors. Vishwanathan was there on the first floor doing the vedic rituals, while the guests were invited in the ground floor. His friend saw Vishwanathan in the ground floor attending to the guests in the ground floor. He was wondering how he could be present in the gorund floor while he was attending to the vedic rituals. However when he went up to the first floor, Vishwanathan told his friend how he regretted not being in the ground floor inviting guests. The friend was shocked and he told Vishwanathan that he was very much present in the ground floor receiving the guests. Now Vishwanathan knew it was Bhagavan who had come and performed this leela as he had promised. His friend went and reported the whole incident to Bhagavan and Bhagavan attributed to his Father. Bhagavan also blessed one scheme of Vishanathan and assured that his district would be number one and Vishwanathan’s scheme was a grand success and true to Bhagavan’s words, it ranked number one.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

The Bairgai on the other hand behaved like a master and informed Bhagwan that someone had stolen his Kamandalam (bowl to eat food). Bhagwan took out 10 Rs. and handed it to the Bairagi, who got angry. Bhagwan asked Appan if one could buy kamandalam with 10 Rs, to which Appan said “Yes, one can get a mud pot” but the Bairagi was still mad, so Bhagwan took out 20 Rs and same thing repeated with Appan saying one could get an Aluminum pot. This repeated until Bhagwan gave the Bairagi 60 Rs, which satisfied him. After this the Bairagi performed a pooja for this Guru, through whose grace he received this money. He performed it with a Mango and offered a piece to the Lord, one piece to Bhagwan and one to Appan. Bhagwan gestured Appan to consume the fruit and had one Himself.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

But you have to remember Bhagwan constantly. Be ever vigilant and alert, even a minutes lapse in remembering Bhagwan’s name will result in Fate breaking havoc. In moments of weakness the mind will go after wordly things and along with that Fate will also enter, negative forces are kept away as long as you are chanting the name.

Rajmanika Nadar &Rajdurai Nadar were a great devotee of Bhagwan insisted on purchasing a house at Sannathi street for Bhagwan ..Yogiji had suffered a lot at the hands of hooligans …to which he agreed.\nIn course of time, Rajdurai Nadar passed away. Rajamanickam Nadar wanted to a memorial for him and insisted that his son Chandraprakash to take permission from Bhagwan to have his memorial which was permitted by bhagwan. They visited Gandhigram and saw a gandhi stupi which was 32 feet. They reported this to Bhagwan and He okayed for 32 feet memorial. He visited place near Kanyakumari, Mailadi, bought a sample of polished granite and showed it to Bhagwan. Bhagwan had one look at it and said “NO”. THen he went to Mahabalipuram and showed the stone to Bhagwan but every time he said no. Bhagavan said near sivakasi, there is a place called “Kaiyanallur” . There is a mahatma called Ponaiyya swamigal. They had built a memorial . HE asked them to go and ask where they got the stone. They found it was from Kodangipatti. They saw 5 hills and there was a village with stone cutters doing their job for generations. Then Bhagwan aksed him to go to mahabalipuram and meet Ganapathi stapathi to get the drawing ready. Ganapathi stapathi was an expert in temple architecture. He happily agreed to do the job after he heard the name of Bhagwan and insisted to meet Bhagwan. Then Bhagwan approved the drawing. He wanted 16ftx16ft stones. The people in Kodangipatti said, out of the 5 hills, they use only 2. One had a murugan temple and the other two the stones were brittle. So they said 16x16ft stone is not possible . Bhagwan asked Chandraprakash to describe what he saw there in Kodangipatti. Swami said go ask the stone cutters to cut stone from the mountain that is facing the Murugan temple. The stone cutters said that the hill that swami had mentioned is very brittle. But Swami insisted.. only that mountain should be cut. So he approached the people again and insisted to cut that hill. Then they agreed but wanted daily wages. They used an explosive and to their surprise, they found out that it was not brittle. They could find huge stones as requested by Ganapathi sthapathi. Swami also asked Ganapathi stapathi to go see Gyananandha memorial..It was hexogonal and Swami said he wanted the same kind of structure. When it was completed, Bhagwan said it will be a holy place and it will be this Beggar’s statue there. And who ever came and prayed there after lighting agarbathi, their prayers will be answered.\nPlease follow the link for the satsang in youtube."

One day wallowing in self pity and agony as he was going, he met a Hindu friend of his who asked him why he was so miserable. On hearing his situation the Hindu friend asked him to go and see one Swamiji, our Bhagwan. The muslim, his name is Abdul said that he had heard about him but was apprehensive because VIPs came to see that Swamiji and he was muslim and very poor also. He had doubts if the Swamiji would see him. His Hindu friend said that he cannot have such thoughts even without making an attempt to see Bhagwan. So the next day Abdul went to see Bhagwan. The queue was very long, the sun was scorching and as time passed Abdul thought that he could never make it. He then even decided to leave. At that moment Bhagwan’s assistant came running and shouting that there was a muslim in the queue whom Bhagwan wanted to see immediately. Abdul was surprised how Bhagwan knew he was a muslim. When he saw Bhagwan he prostrated but Bhagwan stopped him saying his religion did not permit that. Bhagwan then asked him what he wanted, blessed him and said “Sowkhiyama iruppe” meaning you will live well. Before leaving Abdul requested a photo of Bhagwan. To this Bhagwan said that in his religion they dont pray this way. Bhagwan blessed him saying “Pray to Allah. Allah blesses you”. Thereafter in a few days he got a good job with a decent salary in the PWD department. He was posted elsewhere and he moved on. He was so happy and grateful to Bhagwan, he came to see bhagwan once or twice. After Bhagwan’s samadhi he had come now and by this time it was 5’O Clock which was his Namaz time. He then sought permission to do Namaz in front of the samadhi siva linga of Bhagwan who was God himself.
