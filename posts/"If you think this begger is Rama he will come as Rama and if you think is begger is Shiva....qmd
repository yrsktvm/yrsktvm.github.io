Bhagawan started Chanting Jaya Hanuman and explained how Hanumaji comes to rescue him when he is in danger, In North People believed Hanuman protects Rama Bakthas. Papa ramdas initiated me with Rama nama but I am not Rama baktha. Yet Hanuman protects me. Sivaramakrishna Iyer said that Bhagawan is Rama himself, Bhagawan started laughing and declared "If you think this beggar is Rama he will come as Rama and if you think is beggar is Shiva, he will will come as Shiva and if you think this beggar as your friend and call out Yogi Ramsuratkumar, Father will immediately send help!"
