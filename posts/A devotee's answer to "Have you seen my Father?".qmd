While, once, in Sannadhi street Bhagavan asked a devotee who was staying with Him, 'I have not seen My Father, have you Seen Him?'. Bhagavan kept repeatedly asking this to that devotee. Devotee was perplexed with this repeated question and was clueless for a response. Again next day at about 10 again Bhagavan asked the same to this devotee. Devotee responded saying, 'I don't know who your Father is, but I have seen you & Father, who is right now in front of me'. Bhagavan then burst into laughter and stopped asking, becaues he made that devotee understand.
