Once a family had come to Bhagwan and there was a young married man who asked Bhagwan what Peace of Mind was. Bhagwan looked at him with a strange expression and said 'my dear friend, looking after parents with care and concern is the way to peace of mind'. The young man then asked what about those who dont have parents. Bhagwan said sharply "that is not your concern. You have parents. Your peace is in taking care of them with concern."
