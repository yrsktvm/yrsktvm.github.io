Yogiji enquired about his daily routine of Sandhya vandanam and whether he calls Rama, Krishna and Trivikrama. This devotee immediately answered yes. Bhagavan told to include Yogi Ramsuratkumar nama too as all these names are my names. So Yogi Ramsuratkumar nama is not just a name but powerful alive consciousness. It is not the man with the turban and panchakacham but it's the vibrant, infinite chaithanyam.
