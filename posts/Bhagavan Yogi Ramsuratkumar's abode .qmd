When a family had come for bhagavan's darshan in Arunachaleshwar mandir,they told they missed to see HIM the last time as HIS residence in Sannadhi street was locked. Pointing out to sanctum sanctorum of the temple, Bhagavan told that HIS abode is there for ages and ages there and that is only his natural place of residence and Sannadhi street house is only a temporary arrangement. And while saying this Bhagavan's face became radiant.
