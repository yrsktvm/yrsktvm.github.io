Ma talks about the importance of Seva, Bhagavan talked about Shri Arubindo saying "Take up some work or the other all the time, never idle away your time" and Bhagavan supported it by adding "Do the work and offer it to the Guru". Ma also narrates the story of Shri Perumalraju Ayya, where Bhagavan asked him to narrate a page from "Teachings of Buddha" which says, to do any work with entire heart and mind, if you do it half heartedly there will be consequences through Karmic effects. Bhagavan mentioned "Nama offering is also an action and do it with satifsfaction of the Guru. Guru Nama and Seva is the shortest and fastest path to God"
