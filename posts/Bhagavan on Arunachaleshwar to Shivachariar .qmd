The oldest Shivacharya was Yogiji's devotee and he came for HIS darshan to seek blessings for the temple celebrations. Bhagavan asked him to go and seek blessings from the Arunachaleshwara, to whom the priest did pooja and prayed. The devotee replied he cannot speak to the deity but he could speak with Yogiji. Pat came the reply, that politicians talk but never honour their words whereas Lord Arunachaleshwara never talks but keep up HIS words, does HIS duty and gives blessings. Bhagavan says about Arunachaleshwara that HE has no eyes, but sees. HE has no ears, but hears. He has no hands but works. Arunachaleshwara is working all the time and asked the shivacharya to go and worship Arunachaleshwara.
