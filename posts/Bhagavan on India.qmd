Ma narrates the story when Bhagavan asked Jayaraman, "How is India doing?" and Jayaraman replied "India is Progressing Bhagavan". Later Ma talks about Everything is Grace mentioned in Yoga Vashishtam and how mind accepts all profits and therefore will accept when you say everything is grace. This acceptance leads to surrender. Ma also repeated Swami Sivananda's words "God gives and forgives, Man takes and forgets".
