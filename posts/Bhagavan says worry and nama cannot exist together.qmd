Usha Jayakar was worried about some problems in household. Bhagavan declared when Nama is there in heart and mind, there is no worry. Worry and Nama cannot exist together. Every worry must be converted into nama. Nama gives the feeling of fulfillment, then there is no complaint in the mind. So this is how sages and saints have always chanted the name and there is no room for agitation and worry. Bhagavan added that there must be FAITH in heart.
