Ma narrates several incidents where Bhagwaan did Lord Arunachala's work or was Lord Arunachala Himself. The Deepam at Tiruvannamalai is supposed to be lit for 11 days, but for some time due to some reason it was being lit out within 3 days. When Bhagwaan noticed this, he called out the temple officials and asked them why this was happening. To which they replied, the ghee is being stolen. Bhagwaan gave them a solution to mix camphor in it and people won't steal and then no one stole the ghee anymore.
