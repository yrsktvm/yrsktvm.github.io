Will and Jones stayed with Bhagavan for months and when Gnanananda Giri swami attained Mahasamadhi, Bhagavan went to Tapovanam and ignored Will and Jones. They got upset and left Bhagavan!. Later Bhagavan explained to them that their presence was not conducive for father's work and lot of father's work needed to be done at Tapovanam at that time! Will later suffered from a black magic by a swami at chennai who initially gave him psychedelics. Yogi Ramsuratkumar healed him from that sufering!
