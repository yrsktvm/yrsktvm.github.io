Once a devotee was questioning Bhagwan on the Order and Harmony in the universe. In explaination Bhagwan asked to see his brother who was studying for doctor and asked himto see the anatomy section of his brother's work place. When he went the first thing he saw was the abdominal section so tightly packed with all the organs. He exclaimed and his brother gave an explanation saying all these organs are so perfectly placed that even a minute displacement woiuld give enormous pain, that it is so designed that it is perfect. Harmony and perfection beyond the seeming chaos is thus brought out.
