A lady professor, well known to Ma Devaki came for Bhagwan's darshan. She kept gesturing to Ma Devaki to be allowed for darshan. So Ma Devaki asked Bhagwan and then Bhagwan called her in and blessed her well. Just before leaving she told Bhagwan that she had come for darshan three times and only this fourth time she had got his darshan. Bhagwan's face changed. He asked how long she had been staying in Thiruvannamalai. She replied 11 years. Then Bhagwan said staying in Thiruvannamalai for 11 years you came to see this beggar only three times. Now the calculations didn't seem right. The professor immediately realised. Bhagwan had caught her and put her in her place.
