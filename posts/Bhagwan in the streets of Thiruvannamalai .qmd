Bhagwan came out of the Temple with Vishwanath and one other devotee and walked through the streets around the Temple. They visited some tea stalls, where in one such shop, Bhagwan stopped and spoke with the people there.
Bhagwan brought 2 packets of puffed rice and some snacks from a sweet shop.
Bhagwan explained how the local Vedpathashala was replaced by High school. Further ahead was a cinema hall which had a poster of movie Satya and Yogiji started to reflect on Gandhi's concept of Satya and non violence. Ahead was a shop with photos of leaders and gods and the photo of Indira Gandhi.
