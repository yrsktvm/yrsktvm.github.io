There was a serious problem in their family. So Nateshji and his family came to see Bhagwan. Each one of them narrated the problem with so much emotion and anxiety. After this Bhagwan simply said one thing "So What". This contained so much meaning that later Nateshji's wife said she found it like a mantra that whatever problems may come, the words So What would handle the issues.
