Once an editor asked him that why He was partial to India as he always talks great of India..Yogiji apologised to the man for such partiality. ,
Yogiji later on, explained to Devaki ma that India was a punya Bhoomi, lila bhumi, land abound with spiritual gurus â€¦
We should always remember our guru and perform our duties. This would help us do our work efficiently. If everyone did their work in this manner, the whole nation would prosper thus making India as the world guru..
Bhagwan always said that we must have Bhaya Bhakti for our guru, ie.,respect with Bhakti.
