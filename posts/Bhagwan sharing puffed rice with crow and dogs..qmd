Yogiji had two packets of puffed rice. He gave one to Vishwanath and asked him to share with the other devotee and He opened another one and started eating Himself.
He noticed a crow & dog circling him with whom he shared his own share. Then, he asked Vishwanath to distribute equally the snacks bought by them from a nearby sweets shop.
