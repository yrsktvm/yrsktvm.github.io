Bhagwan mentions that Shri Aurobindo would always believe in intellectual arguments till he got the Anubhava of Lord Krishna. After the divine Anubhava, he would see and enjoy everything as Krishna Leela.
Bhagwan said once we experience the divine within us, we shall see the same divine being inside everything and every where.
