Ma narrates the story of Bhagavan talking about the 'right vision in life' to Agaram Jayaraman. Bhagavan performed a leela where he acted scared of something dark lying in the corner and asked Jayaraman to check it with caution and when Jayaraman checked and replied it is only a cobweb, Bhagavan laughed and said "Did you see Jayaraman, when you trust in God, you won't consider a cobweb to be a snake, this is the right vision",
