Kamala was doing pooja in her home for Bhagavan's photo on Bhagavan's birthday as her friend told HE couldn't be found in HIS house and it's difficult to locate HIM in Thiruvannamalai. Sometimes HIS house will be locked. She thought to herself probably HE would have gone to Kailash. After 3 days when she went to Thiruvannamalai and met Yogiji. Someone at doors enquired about HIM and asked Bhagavan where HE had gone on his birthday. Immediately pat came the reply from Bhagavan that he had gone to Kailash. Bhagavan ia all knowing, omnipresent. What kamalaji thought in her mind, HE could understand.
