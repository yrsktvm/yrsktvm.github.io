But Jones was sweating a lot and the letter go damaged with a hole! Bhagavan got upset "You people spoiled my father's work! You people don't understand! It is not a mere letter! Everything this begger does is father's work! Every detail is important! When you people don't do what  I tell you, Rectification is very difficult for this begger! " Then he took the letter and circled the hole and gave it to post. "Now take it to post office! This begger has done something!
