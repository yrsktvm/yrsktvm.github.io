When Hariram went for his darshan and met him in the temple. A mendicant who plucked flowers for Arunachaleshwara came there. Bhagwan asked him "have you eaten?" He said "no.". Bhagwan said"ok. You go and give the flowers and come back. Food will be waiting for you here". A rich man came to meet Bhagwan with plate full of eatables and fruits. When  the mendicant came back, he was surprised to see so much food. Bhagwan said you can eat all this.
