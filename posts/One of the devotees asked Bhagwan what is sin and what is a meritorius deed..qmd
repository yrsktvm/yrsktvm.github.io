Once one of the devotees asked Bhagwan what is sin and what is a meritorius deed. To this Bhagwan said that remembering God is a good deed, is right and forgetting Him is a sin. Then Bhagwan asked what Culture meant. All those present gave some explanations and finally looked upto Bhagwan. Bhagwan said that whatever they said like politeness and diplomacy and not losing one's temper were all necessary and  okay but with all these if one does not remember God then he cannot be a man of culture.
