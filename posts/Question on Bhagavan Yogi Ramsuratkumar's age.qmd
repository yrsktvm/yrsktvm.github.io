To have darshan this officer came with his family to sannidhi street. His daughter asked bhagavan about HIS age. Bhagavan after being quite for sometime replies,that this beggar is eternal and HE has no birth or death. After HE pronounced this statement, there was huge silence and something about HIS true nature is passed on.
