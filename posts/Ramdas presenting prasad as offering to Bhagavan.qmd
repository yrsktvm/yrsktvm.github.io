An IAS officer and Commissioner of Hindu Endowments, Shri.Ramdas used to come for Bhagwan's darshan periodically.  Once, he brought an Apple that he got as Prasad from Arunachaleshwara Temple and offered it to Bhagwan. Bhagwan gave it back to him, saying this was already eaten by Lord Arunachaleshwara. This left Shri Ramdas baffled.
