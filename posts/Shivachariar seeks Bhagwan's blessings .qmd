At one time, foreseeing some problems in conducting the Temple Brahmotsavam function smoothly, the Temple Shivachariar sought Bhagwan's blessings. Bhagwan advised him to seek blessings and help of Sri.Arunachaleshwara. When the priest said that the Lord doesn't speak, Bhagwan corrected him by saying, "The Lord doesn't have ears, but listens. Doesn't have eyes, but sees. Doesn't have mouth, but speaks and tastes food."
