Bhagwan receives two German ladies who had received many letters to Him, they ask Bhagwan before leaving for Kashi Bhagwan what should be our Sadhana ? Bhagwan said "This BEGGAR will do your sadhana. You are thinking about this Beggar, serving this Beggar in many ways That will do. This Beggar will do your sadhana" Ma Devaki says this is for all of us, we have to engage ourselves in his service with our full attention any work that falls in our hands through him we should do it with our full attention. We do not have to worry about sadhana, vision of God etc He will take care of the rest.
