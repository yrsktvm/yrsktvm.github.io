When some Vaishnavites had come to Sannadhi street Bhagavan asked if Vrindhavan and Mathura were divya deshas. The Vaishnavites said no. Bhagavan said just because it was not included in the divya deshas, you cannot say that they are not divya deshas. Bhagwan said Where ever the Lord is, there the Vaikunta is and where ever the Lord's name is being sung there the Lord is. Since we sing the name of Bhagavan Yogi Ramsuratkumar, this is our Vaikunta and Kailash.
