When You are the cosmic of universe, why You call Yourself as Beggar asked Mataji Devaki Ma. For which Bhagavan replied, saying it suits me. If I Have to call Myself as God there is a possibility of being attacked by people similar to Sufi saints who were burnt alive . So i have to speak in a language that people will understand.Everything by Bhagavan will be spontaneous and there was not thinking or planning. He will be able to do one thing at a time with deep concentration and penetration.
