@7am every year, we would keep a photo of Gandhi ji, garland it and He would sing his name. "Mahatma Gandhi ki jai","Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ki jai".Bhagwan praise for Gandhiji in terms of his nonviolent philosophy of attaining Ram Rajya and simple life. Loved the bhajans "Raghupathi raghava Raja Ram &Vaishnav Jan toh ", which was dear to Mahatma Gandhi.
