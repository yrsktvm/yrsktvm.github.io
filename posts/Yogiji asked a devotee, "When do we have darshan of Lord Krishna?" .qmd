Yogiji asked a devotee, "When do we have darshan of Lord Krishna?" The devotee said they were already having darshan of Lord Krishna and in fact were seated in front of Lord Krishna at the moment. Bhagwan went into peels of laughter.
Yogiji said that one must have done many great deeds in previous births to have got a guru and to continue doing good deeds in the present birth.
