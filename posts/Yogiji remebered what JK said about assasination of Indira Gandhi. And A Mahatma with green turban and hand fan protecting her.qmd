When Indira Gandhi was assassinated, then JK had said, "Let her go, don't think about her now".
Once, Indira Gandhi was undergoing a very tough time in life, as she was subject to some black magic. She sought the help of some Mahatma to overcome the situation. The Mahatma listened to everything and said, a Mahatma with green turban and a hand fan in His hand was protecting her, and hence, the impact of the black magic would not be severe.
