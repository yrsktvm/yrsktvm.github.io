Once a lady devotee asked Bhagwan after getting blessings for her sister if she should go through the operation. Bhagwan thundered "many patients come to this begger here. But there is no hospital here, no chloroform, no operation, there are no electrical gadgets and there is no medicine. My Father has given a new medicine to the world, the Name - Yogi Ramsurat Kumar. This is the best medicine for all ills of body and mind" and then he added one more sentence "it is best medicine for all ills of life and death."
